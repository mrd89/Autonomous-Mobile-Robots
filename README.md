## Description:
Creating robots capable of performing complex tasks autonomously requires one to address a variety of different challenges such as sensing, perception, control, planning, mechanical design, and interaction with humans. In recent years many advances have been made toward creating such systems, both in the research community (different robot challenges and competitions) and in industry (industrial, military, and domestic robots). This course gives an overview of the challenges and techniques used for creating autonomous mobile robots. Topics include sensing, localization, mapping, path planning, motion planning, obstacle and collision avoidance, and multi-robot control.

## Outcomes
Students will understand and implement localization and mapping algorithms using different sensor modalities.
Be able to generate a path and the motion for a robot moving around an area with obstacles.
Understand and implement the concepts of different approaches for motion planning such as roadmaps, feedback control and sampling based methods.
Be able to apply the tools learned in the class to physical robots.
