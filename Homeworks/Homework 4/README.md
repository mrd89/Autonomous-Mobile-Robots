There might be a slight mismatch with the particle filter here. I had major issues with the PF at the time of homework submission and only later did I correct the issues

Overall, this was my worst assignment and it reflects it... Many issues fixed after submission, but some might be omitted here

ISSUES:
EKF Depth: There are some unkown issues that make the EKF Depth not very accurate. 
PF will NOT work with motionControl without fixing a few issues there. Please see my final project for two working particle filters
